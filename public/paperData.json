        "Blockchain is a distributed ledger of records in a data batches called blocks that use cryptographic method to link them together. We want to enhance the performance of blockchain by accelerate the block rate. As the basis of the enhancement, we have to know the propagation time in the network. This work addresses the difference of the time in various topology. Hence, we gather data by simulating a network of numerous node repeatedly. We then analyze those data using our program.",

      "abstract":
        "Dota 2: Hero Suggestion System (D2HS) is created to suggest better decision to pick heroes from statistics perspective, which are characters with unique abilities and skills. Normal and high skilled players can develop and improve their strategies. D2HS involved using Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) to define relations between heroes and statistics of past games. PLP is applied to the data sets. These data sets will be trained and used to analyze userâ€™s inputs. Probabilistic Argumentation (ProbArg) is applied to enable argumentation after training, which further arguments will be used to enhance the results.",
